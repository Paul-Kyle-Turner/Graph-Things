Prim's algorithm
Prim's algorithm with the use of a priority queue will run in the time of O((|V| + |E|)log(|V|))
This is because of the priority queue will be called V times to Extract the Min of the queue.
If the use of a normal array however there will be |E| runtime on finding the min edge per each vector.
This then applies that if the graph is sparely populated |E| will estimate to |V| and therefore run at
O(|V|), however if the graph is dense and the estimated |E| is close to |V^2| then the runtime will be
O(|V^2|) thus if a sparse graph is used, a normal array would run faster then the priority queue.
